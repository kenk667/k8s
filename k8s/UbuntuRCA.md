**Why we need Ubuntu**

The need derives from Mad Hatter's experimentation for open source K8s (Kubernetes). K8s don't play well with SELinux on RedHat and derivative kernels and Ubuntu is a better choice as a result for bare-metal K8s deployments

**Existing Ubuntu usage within USAF/Kessel Run**

The stem cells and Diego run times within Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) are Ubuntu backed virtual machines that are running in production workloads across GovCloud, NIPR, and SIPR today

**Immediate need for connectivity**

For Mad Hatter we will need a minimum of NIPR as well as potentially USAF specific UNCLASSIFIED networks for F-35 flight line operations

**Road map**

There may be a need for SIPR connectivity down the road, but is unclear at this time as to how imminent that need is today
